/*
Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4). The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following linear equation:
    (y1- y2)x - (x1- x2)y = (y1- y2)x1 - (x1- x2)y1
    (y3- y4)x - (x3- x4)y = (y3- y4)x3 - (x3- x4)y3
This linear equation can be solved using Cramerâ€™s rule (see Programming Exercise 3.3). If the equation has no solutions, the two lines are parallel. Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays the intersecting point.

Cramer's rule:
    ax + by= e , cx + dy= f so x = (ed- bf)/(ad- bc) and y = (af- ec)/(ad- bc)
