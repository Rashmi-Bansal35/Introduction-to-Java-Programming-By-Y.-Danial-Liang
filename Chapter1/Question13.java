/*
You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
ax + by= e , cx + dy= f so x = (ed- bf)/(ad- bc) and y = (af- ec)/(ad- bc)
Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5 and 2.1x + .55y = 5.9
a = 3.4 , b = 50.2 , e = 44.5 , c = 2.1 , d = 0.55 , f = 5.9
